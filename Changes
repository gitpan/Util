0.04  Fri Jul 04 12:37:36 2003

    various AWOL snippets of code and documentation hunted down and added:

	new: dquote, squote, apply, arrayref, coderef, hashref,
	      scalarref, find, csv, min, max and swap 

    removed Tie::IxHash dependency from test script

    added documentation for reader() and removed GENERATOR interface to it
    from readfile()

    added atime() and ctime() to mtime() to round out the stat() trilogy

    renamed uid -> id() to keep it out of setuid()'s hair 

    assorted POD cleanups

    hid documentation for private subs/classes

    fixed glaring bug in any(): was using fixed upper bound value 
    for the array instead of redefining it after each splice

    added swap()

    added README and license info

    Thanks to Joshua Keroes and Jeroen Latour for a variety of fixes,
    suggestions, feedback &c.
