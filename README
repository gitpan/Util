Util version 0.02
==================

Util - Frequently Hacked Functions

Util is a cookbook of tasty functions for the terminally
lazy, impatient and hubristic.

It features XS versions of such FAQ-fare as clone() and isnum() (including
isint(), isfloat() &c), as well as pure perl implementations of such timewasters
as min(), max(), swap(), readfile(), writefile() and appendfile(). Throughout,
the emphasis is on high performance, best practice and fun.

See the POD for more info.
