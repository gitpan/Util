Util version 0.06
==================

Util - Frequently Hacked Functions

Util is a cookbook of tasty functions for the terminally
lazy, impatient and hubristic.

It features XS versions of such FAQ-fare as clone() and isnum() (including
isint(), isfloat() &c), as well as pure perl implementations of such
timewasters as swap(), trim(), readfile(), writefile() and appendfile().
Throughout, the emphasis is on high performance, best practices and fun.

See the POD for more info.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module has the following dependencies:

  Test::More
  Test::Deep
  Math::Complex

  In addition, due to limited support for weak references in older
  versions, clone() only copies these correctly with Perl(s) >= 5.8.0

  The numerical functions (isnum() and its offspring) along with some of
  the tests thereof have proved unreliable on pre-5.8.0 perls as well.
